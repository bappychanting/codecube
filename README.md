###### An easy & lightweight PHP framework inspired by Laravel.
Aims of this framework are to
- Provide a foundation to creative PHP developers for faster dynamic website development. Small, hand-built libraries that the framework is based on guarantee minimum performance overhead.  
- Assist PHP newcomers who are looking forward to begin coding in Laravel. Due to familiar, pure PHP coding in a similar structure to Laravel framework, it will be easier for a PHP beginner to adopt this framework, evaluate how the basics of a web framework work and switch to Laravel later on.
